          I'm computer science <span className="colorFade">student </span>
          living in Wroc≈Çaw. Due to all university work I've obviously met C++,
          Java and a few low-level programming languages. However I decided to
          focus completely on web developement and eventually end up with C#
          .NET and JS-related frameworks. Since it's still a begining of this
          adventure and it's all about learning, I'm open to other technologies.
          Right now I would describe myself as a{" "}
          <span className="colorFade">frontend</span> dev wannabe, eager to make
          some nice looking things, but interested in some
          <span className="colorFade"> backend</span> work as well.
