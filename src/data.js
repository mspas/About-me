      "The 'social media' module of this app I made for my bachelor thesis. What I mean by 'social-media' is user profiles, friends lists, creating events " +
      "and private messages. Client APP was made with Angular 5, when API with .NET Core 2.0 and Entity Framework. After that I was coming back to this project. " +
      "from time to time. Once I redesigned layouts and added forum module, other time I reworked API, since I wasn't really happy how it was done. Rercently, backed with new experience " +
      "and knowledge I've returned to it in order to prepare the app for deployment. However, when I saw my code from around 2 years ago, I decided that I should not even bother " +
      "with deployment of such a monstrosity. After almost a month of reworking the client app, I'm finally ready to present its current stage. " +
      "In this demo version you can log in as a prepared demo-user (login: kazio7, password: demoacc), however in this case all of the implementation that affects the state of whole app are disabled. " +
      "Meaning you can only click-around the app, send a message to someone, post new forum message, but you cannot change profile picture or throw away players from existing games. " +
      "On the other hand if you decide to create new account, all the functionalities will be available. This vesion of the app allows creating and signing-in to the accounts, " +
      "searching players or games, creating new ones, creating and deleting topics and messages in game's forum, managing players within the game, sending private messages. " +
      "Also in case of small funny thing that I've implemented here, it is worth to mention about uploading own profile images and also posting forum-messages with images inside. " +
      "However the app is not completely finished, since it still needs implementation for refreshing access tokens for logged users and probably some SignalR usage for pushing " +

      "in order to import them into the React app and compare their performance to their JavaScript equivalent implementation. It was possible due to the fact " +
      "that I've worked on images represented by arrays of usigned 8-bit integers, so any complicated external tools were not needed, just operating on numbers in given manner. " +
      "Looking at the most important conclusions of the thesis - the research proved that time of asm.js has already gone and it ended up with approximately 4% slowdown for V8 browsers in compare to JS, while being even 34% slower " +
      "for Firefox. WebAssembly on the other hand came out to be faster above 50% in compare to JS on Chromium-based browsers, while Firefox resulted with much less significant " +
      "improvement â€“ around 16%. Further investigation showed that usage of the C malloc function was highly demanding for SpiderMonkey (the Firefox engine) and on " +
      "its own it was almost doubling the execution time of the measured functionality, while for Chrome it was on average only 22% of influence. " +
      "There was also exerienced an odd situation where WebAssembly is highly influenced by active browser's DevTool - being slowed down by 1.9 times in Chromium-based " +
