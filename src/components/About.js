          I'm computer science <span className="colorFade">student </span>
          located in Wroc≈Çaw. Due to all university duties I've started my
          programming journey from C, C++ and Java. However, after some time
          (precisely, after my uni project "Office Pathfinder", more in
          "Projects" section), I decided to focus completely on web developement
          and eventually end up with C# .NET and JS-related frameworks.
          Nonetheless, <span className="colorFade">frontend</span> is my biggest
          interest for now. For me, it gives vent to imagination and creativity
          with some technical spice within. But some ideas include
          functionalities that require also a server-side work. Thanks for that
          I will not feel so lost if it comes to some{" "}
          <span className="colorFade">backend</span> work.
